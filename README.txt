Known Bugs
	NONE LOL

Areas we would like feedback on:
	Layout advice for random decision. We think space below buttons looks odd, add a rectangle outline for where decision output is?
	
	Layout advice for food decision. Would a small map view at the bottom be helpful?

	We are thinking of getting rid of the main menu and using a hamburger naivgation drawer instead.
